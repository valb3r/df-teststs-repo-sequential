Test project for UT/coverage calculation
Commits of 6 organizations x 3 commits:
1. org-increases-loc10.com - increases covered lines by 10 each commit
2. org-decreases-loc5.com - decreases covered lines by 5 each commit
3. org-does-nothing.com - does nothing that changes UT's statistics
4. org-adds-uts2.com - adds 2 unit tests each commit
5. org-removes-uts1.com - removes 1 unit test each commit
6. org-inc-loc5-add-ut1.com increases covered lines by 5 each commit, adds 1 UT
7. org-fail-build.com fails build every commit
8. org-restore-build.com restores build every commit
Commit pattern by organizations:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,... total 21 commits
Results for organizations expected per this project:
1 - +30 covered lines, no UT change
2 - -15 covered lines, no UT change
3 - nothing (empty stats)
4 - no covered line change, +6 UT's
5 - no covered line change, -3 UT's
6 - +15 covered lines, + 3 UT's
7 - <NO DATA> - fails build
8 - <NO DATA> - restores build
